## Expense Tracker: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Expense Tracker app for Android!

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. The app does access users' SMS data (only if permission is given) to gather information about the users' expenses to help them track and manage them efficiently and have some basic statistics about their transactions but all the data is stored on the device only and no collection/sharing of data occurs. Also, users can restrict the app to read SMS by denying the permission or removing it from settings at any point of time. Some features of the app do depend on the access but at the end its upto the user. Also, all data can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

<br/>

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` | Required to keep checking for new SMS even after restart of phone. |
| `android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | Required to show notifications. |
| `android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS` | Required to receive an incoming SMS so that the app can recognize and track transactions for the user automatically. |
| `android.permission.READ_SMS` | Required to read the content of SMS received so that the app can recognize and track transactions for the user automatically. |

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.
